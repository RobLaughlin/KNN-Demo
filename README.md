[Here](https://gfycat.com/milkyflippantbarasinga) is a visual animation of 3D_example.py.  
The points with a dark outline around them indicate they are test data points, and these are points which were classified
based on their nearest neighbors, with the K used being the default sqrt(N) where N is the number of data points.
